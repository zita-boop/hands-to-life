## ARTIST STATEMENT
From Hands to Life
From Hands to Life is a visual art series that reflects on quiet growth, unseen labor, and faith through the symbolism of rice fields. Each image portrays hands, soil, roots, and time—elements that often go unnoticed, yet sustain life.
This series draws inspiration from the patience required in cultivation, where progress is rarely instant and outcomes cannot be rushed. Like faith, growth happens beneath the surface long before it becomes visible. Rice, as a symbol of sustenance and humility, represents the sacred connection between human effort and natural rhythm.
From Hands to Life invites the viewer to slow down, honor small beginnings, and recognize that what is nurtured in silence often carries the greatest meaning.
